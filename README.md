###### Branches:

**1.x** started in 2011 and has evolved by paying high attention to version compatibility to allow little migration effort.

**2.x** started in 2019 to make some significant improvements that also need new, simplified signatures. Added features include

* multiple sources for directed hyperedges
* easy edge class definition using case classes thus easy definition of edge ADTs
* improved functional graph handling

There is still much left to do before 2.0 is ready for shipment.

**3.x** is planned to support functional immutability by representing immutable graphs by a persistent data structure.
